# Assembly Amusement Park Simulation

Welcome to **Thrill Park**, a command-line amusement park simulation built entirely in **Assembly Language** using the **Irvine32 library**. This educational project showcases fundamental concepts of x86 assembly such as loops, conditionals, procedure calls, and data handling—all through a fun, interactive CLI-based experience!

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Thrill Park** is a mini amusement park management simulation written in **MASM Assembly (x86)**. Users can book tickets for a variety of rides, each with different prices and age restrictions. It offers input validation, pricing calculations, ride summaries, and a basic ASCII UI to enhance the user experience.

### ✨ Features

- **6 Different Rides** – From Roller Coasters to Pirate Ships  
- **Age Verification** – Age checks for age-restricted rides  
- **Ticket Booking System** – Book multiple rides & tickets per session  
- **Real-Time Pricing** – Calculated cost based on ride and user input  
- **ASCII Art Display** – A nostalgic CLI-style amusement park banner  
- **Multi-Ride Booking Flow** – Loop until the user opts out  
- **Final Summary Output** – Total rides booked and final price

## 🧠 Educational Purpose

This project was created as a fun side project during Assembly Language learning in university. It demonstrates:

- Real-world control flow logic in assembly
- Use of procedures and data sections
- Interactive CLI input/output in low-level programming

If you are an aspiring systems programmer or want to deeply understand how software works at the machine level, this is a great place to start.
